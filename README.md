# Sandbox
Sandbox is an open source CSS framework. 

## Installation
```
npm install sandbox-css
```

## Description
Sandbox is a CSS only framework written in SASS, which complies to a single CSS file.

Sandbox is completely JavaScript free, leaving users the freedeom to implement their own JS if need be.

## Usage
Sandbox can be used as is, by inlcuding the `sandbox-min.css` file found in the the `dist/` drectory and linking to it in your `html` file.

The other (intended) way to use Sandbox is by customzing the variables, or editing the code as you see fit, and running your own build.

## Build
After making your changes, run a build with:

```
npm run build
```

The SASS will compile and output your new `sandbox-min.css` to the `dist/` directory.

## Compatibility
Sandbox uses Autoprefixer to take care of vendor specific prefixes, so there's no need to write them yourself.
